Hello World, I am an experienced Full Stack Web Developer and Creative Designer. I love creating visually appealing and impactful designs that connect with people. I am specialized in thoughtfully selecting layouts, colors, and typography in the digital realm to ensure designs are both visually striking and highly functional.

Beyond my design skills, I bring a deep understanding of technical standards and modern design practices, fueled by my technology enthusiasm and a constant drive to stay ahead of industry trends. As a self-taught Blockchain and Web3 developer, Iâ€™ve gained valuable knowledge in these cutting-edge fields, further enhancing my ability to create innovative and functional digital solutions.

I'm open to new job opportunities or collaborating on some awesome new projects.
