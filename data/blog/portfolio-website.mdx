## Readme

### Welcome to My Developer Portfolio

Explore my work as a web developer, where I build functional and user-friendly digital solutions using cutting-edge technologies.
My portfolio highlights my skills, project achievements, and experiences in the tech world, specifically with a focus on web applications and hosting.

### Technologies I Use

**React.js:**
React.js is at the core of my front-end work. I leverage its component-based architecture to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces, ensuring seamless and responsive user experiences across all devices.

**Next.js:**
With Next.js, I develop full-featured applications that benefit from server-side rendering (SSR) and optimized performance. This framework allows me to create highly scalable and SEO-friendly applications tailored for modern web needs.

**Tailwind CSS:**
To enhance design consistency and improve styling efficiency, I use Tailwind CSS. Its utility-first approach lets me build attractive, responsive designs directly within my codebase, streamlining the development process without sacrificing creativity.

**JavaScript:**
JavaScript is my main programming language, enabling me to bring interactivity and complex functionality to applications. My strong command of JavaScript allows me to create efficient, robust code that enhances the overall user experience.

### Web Hosting & Domain Management

**Hosting with Vercel:**
I utilize Vercel to deploy and host my projects, taking advantage of its seamless integration with Next.js and React.js applications. Vercelâ€™s efficient deployment workflows and serverless functions ensure that my applications are fast, reliable, and scalable, offering users an optimized experience.

**Domain Registration with Porkbun:**
For domain management, I use Porkbun, a reliable and user-friendly domain registrar. This allows me to maintain a professional online presence with custom domains, making my projects accessible and polished.

### Template:

**Next.js:** [Tailwind CSS Starter Blog Template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog)
To create my website, I used the Next.js Tailwind CSS Starter Blog template from Vercel. This template provided a solid foundation for a responsive, customizable blog that showcases my projects and experiences. Using this setup, I was able to quickly implement clean design elements and a robust structure with minimal setup time, allowing me to focus on content and functionality.
