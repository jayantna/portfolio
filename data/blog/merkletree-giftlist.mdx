_Title_: MerkeTree GiftList

_Github_: https://github.com/jayantna/MerkleTree-GiftList

An application which gives out gifts,
but only to names on the list. The catch is that on the server you are only
allowed to store one 32 byte value in the server memory.
This 32 byte value has to be enough for the server to be able to determine who is on the list.
